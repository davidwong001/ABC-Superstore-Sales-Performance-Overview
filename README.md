# ABC Superstore Sales Performance Overview

## 📚 Background About the Project and Data

My goal was to create a Tableau dashboard using Tableau's sample Superstore dataset as a way for stakeholders to monitor the business's performance. On top of that, I wanted to perform my own analysis on the business's performance using the dashboard itself.

This Superstore dataset is pretty thorough containing data on sales, orders, products, returns, managers, locations, and more. 

## 💡 Highlights

- Valuations in year 2021 makes up one-third of total valuations since the beginning of time.
- Unicorns in United States and China outperformed the rest of the world with 72% overall valuations.
- Bytedance, SpaceX, SHEIN and Stripe are the most successful unicorns which performed better than an average unicorn at $71 billion.
- Unicorns in AI, E-Commerce, Fintech and Edtech industries are valued higher than the average unicorn at $3.5 billion. 
- A unicorn takes an average of 7 years to attain valuation of $1billion and become a unicorn.

## ✏️ Data Cleaning

Tableau's Superstore dataset looked ready to use in my opinion. I decided to use the data without any modifications, as it was perfect for what I needed to create a dashboard.
