# ABC Superstore Sales Performance Overview

## 📚 Background
My goal was to create a Tableau dashboard using Tableau's sample Superstore dataset as a way for stakeholders to monitor the business's performance. On top of that, I wanted to analyze the business's performance using the dashboard itself.

This Superstore dataset thoroughly contains data on sales, orders, products, returns, managers, locations, and more. The data itself looked ready to use. I decided to use the data without any modifications, as it was perfect for what I needed to create a dashboard.

## 💡 Highlights
- Note: Analysis was written based on data on September 10, 2023. Reflecting on this, I should've used the last day of a quarter instead. 
- Sales/profits are up even though the number of orders is down. I suspect we sold products with higher margins.
- The Western/Eastern regions have risen in sales, which led to a net positive, despite the other 2 regions underperforming.
- The number of returns has gone up slightly at 4%.
- Following historical trends, we should expect to see a jump in sales in Q4 as that is when our customers make the most purchases.
