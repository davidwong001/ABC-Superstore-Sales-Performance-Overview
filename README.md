# ABC Superstore Sales Performance Overview

## 📚 Background About the Data and Project

This Superstore dataset was taken from Tableau's very own sample datasets. It's pretty thorough containing data on sales, orders, products, returns, managers, locations, and more. 

My goal was to create a Tableau dashboard using this data as a way for stakeholders to monitor the business's performance. 

## 💡 Highlights

- Valuations in year 2021 makes up one-third of total valuations since the beginning of time.
- Unicorns in United States and China outperformed the rest of the world with 72% overall valuations.
- Bytedance, SpaceX, SHEIN and Stripe are the most successful unicorns which performed better than an average unicorn at $71 billion.
- Unicorns in AI, E-Commerce, Fintech and Edtech industries are valued higher than the average unicorn at $3.5 billion. 
- A unicorn takes an average of 7 years to attain valuation of $1billion and become a unicorn.
