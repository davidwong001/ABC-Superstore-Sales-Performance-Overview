# ABC Superstore Sales Performance Overview

## 📚 Background About the Project and Data

My goal was to create a Tableau dashboard using Tableau's sample Superstore dataset as a way for stakeholders to monitor the business's performance. On top of that, I wanted to analyze the business's performance using the dashboard itself.

This Superstore dataset thoroughly contains data on sales, orders, products, returns, managers, locations, and more. 

## 💡 Highlights

- Note: Analysis was written based on data on September 10, 2023. Reflecting on this, I should've used the last day of a quarter instead. 
- Sales/profits are up even though the number of orders is down. I suspect we sold products with higher margins.
- The Western/Eastern regions have risen in sales, which led to a net positive, despite the other 2 regions underperforming.
- The number of returns has gone up slightly at 4%.
- Following historical trends, we should expect to see a jump in sales in Q4 as that is when our customers make the most purchases.

## ✏️ Data Cleaning

Tableau's Superstore dataset looked ready to use. I decided to use the data without any modifications, as it was perfect for what I needed to create a dashboard.
